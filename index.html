        The Dr Disrespect character originated from Beahm playing Halo 2 on the Xbox, which had proximity voice chat, where players could engage each other, in real-time. This created an opportunity for Beahm to showcase a "dominant character" as he was fairly good at the game and could "back up the talk, which made it more genuine."
        
        </li>
        <li>
        
    Beahm and his roommates began posting content to YouTube on January 5, 2010. His first video was posted on January 11, showing gameplay of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. He was featured in multiple videos for the gaming channel Machinima, mostly playing Call of Duty. Beahm went inactive from YouTube in late 2011 and did not release any content for nearly five years.

        <li>Beahm gained a following from playing battle royale games, starting with H1Z1 before switching to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and then moving on to Fortnite Battle Royale and Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.</li>
